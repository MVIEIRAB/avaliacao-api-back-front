[31m-## Updating to New Releases[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Create React App is divided into two packages:[m
[31m-[m
[31m-* `create-react-app` is a global command-line utility that you use to create new projects.[m
[31m-* `react-scripts` is a development dependency in the generated projects (including this one).[m
[31m-[m
[31m-You almost never need to update `create-react-app` itself: it delegates all the setup to `react-scripts`.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-When you run `create-react-app`, it always creates the project with the latest version of `react-scripts` so you’ll get all the new features and improvements in newly created apps automatically.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-To update an existing project to a new version of `react-scripts`, [open the changelog](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), find the version you’re currently on (check `package.json` in this folder if you’re not sure), and apply the migration instructions for the newer versions.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-In most cases bumping the `react-scripts` version in `package.json` and running `npm install` in this folder should be enough, but it’s good to consult the [changelog](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for potential breaking changes.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-We commit to keeping the breaking changes minimal so you can upgrade `react-scripts` painlessly.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-## Sending Feedback[m
[31m-[m
[31m-We are always open to [your feedback](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues).[m
[31m-[m
[31m-## Folder Structure[m
[31m-[m
[31m-After creation, your project should look like this:[m
[31m-[m
[31m-```[m
[31m-my-app/[m
[31m-  README.md[m
[31m-  node_modules/[m

[31m-    index.css[m
[31m-    index.js[m
[31m-    logo.svg[m
[31m-```[m
[31m-[m
[31m-For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:[m
[31m-[m
[31m-* `public/index.html` is the page template;[m
[31m-* `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-You can delete or rename the other files.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-You may create subdirectories inside `src`. For faster rebuilds, only files inside `src` are processed by Webpack.<br>[m
[31m-You need to **put any JS and CSS files inside `src`**, or Webpack won’t see them.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Only files inside `public` can be used from `public/index.html`.<br>[m
[31m-Read instructions below for using assets from JavaScript and HTML.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-You can, however, create more top-level directories.<br>[m
[31m-They will not be included in the production build so you can use them for things like documentation.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-## Available Scripts[m
[31m-[m
[31m-In the project directory, you can run:[m
[31m-[m
[31m-### `npm start`[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Runs the app in the development mode.<br>[m
[31m-Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-The page will reload if you make edits.<br>[m
[31m-You will also see any lint errors in the console.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-### `npm test`[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>[m
[31m-See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-### `npm run build`[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>[m
[31m-It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>[m
[31m-Your app is ready to be deployed![m
[31m-[m
[31m-See the section about [deployment](#deployment) for more information.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-### `npm run eject`[m
[31m-[m
[31m-**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**[m
[31m-[m
[31m-If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-## Supported Language Features and Polyfills[m
[31m-[m
[31m-This project supports a superset of the latest JavaScript standard.<br>[m
[31m-In addition to [ES6](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features) syntax features, it also supports:[m
[31m-[m
[31m-* [Exponentiation Operator](https://github.com/rwaldron/exponentiation-operator) (ES2016).[m
[31m-* [Async/await](https://github.com/tc39/ecmascript-asyncawait) (ES2017).[m
[31m-* [Object Rest/Spread Properties](https://github.com/sebmarkbage/ecmascript-rest-spread) (stage 3 proposal).[m
[31m-* [Class Fields and Static Properties](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-public-fields) (stage 2 proposal).[m
[31m-* [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/introducing-jsx.html) and [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) syntax.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Learn more about [different proposal stages](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/#presets-stage-x-experimental-presets-).[m
[31m-[m
[31m-While we recommend to use experimental proposals with some caution, Facebook heavily uses these features in the product code, so we intend to provide [codemods](https://medium.com/@cpojer/effective-javascript-codemods-5a6686bb46fb) if any of these proposals change in the future.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Note that **the project only includes a few ES6 [polyfills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill)**:[m
[31m-[m
[31m-* [`Object.assign()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign) via [`object-assign`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/object-assign).[m
[31m-* [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) via [`promise`](https://github.com/then/promise).[m
[31m-* [`fetch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) via [`whatwg-fetch`](https://github.com/github/fetch).[m
[31m-[m
[31m-If you use any other ES6+ features that need **runtime support** (such as `Array.from()` or `Symbol`), make sure you are including the appropriate polyfills manually, or that the browsers you are targeting already support them.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-## Syntax Highlighting in the Editor[m
[31m-[m
[31m-To configure the syntax highlighting in your favorite text editor, head to the [relevant Babel documentation page](https://babeljs.io/docs/editors) and follow the instructions. Some of the most popular editors are covered.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-## Displaying Lint Output in the Editor[m
[31m-[m
[31m->Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.2.0` and higher.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Some editors, including Sublime Text, Atom, and Visual Studio Code, provide plugins for ESLint.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-They are not required for linting. You should see the linter output right in your terminal as well as the browser console. However, if you prefer the lint results to appear right in your editor, there are some extra steps you can do.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-You would need to install an ESLint plugin for your editor first.[m
[31m-[m
[31m->**A note for Atom `linter-eslint` users**[m
[31m-[m
[31m->If you are using the Atom `linter-eslint` plugin, make sure that **Use global ESLint installation** option is checked:[m
[31m-[m
[31m-><img src="http://i.imgur.com/yVNNHJM.png" width="300">[m
[31m-[m
[31m-[m
[31m->**For Visual Studio Code users**[m
[31m-[m
[31m->VS Code ESLint plugin automatically detects Create React App's configuration file. So you do not need to create `eslintrc.json` at the root directory, except when you want to add your own rules. In that case, you should include CRA's config by adding this line:[m
[31m-[m
[31m->```js[m
[31m-{[m
[31m-  // ...[m
[31m-  "extends": "react-app"[m
[31m-}[m
[31m-```[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Then add this block to the `package.json` file of your project:[m
[31m-[m
[31m-```js[m

[31m-  }[m
[31m-}[m
[31m-```[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Finally, you will need to install some packages *globally*:[m
[31m-[m
[31m-```sh[m
[31m-npm install -g eslint-config-react-app@0.3.0 eslint@3.8.1 babel-eslint@7.0.0 eslint-plugin-react@6.4.1 eslint-plugin-import@2.0.1 eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y@4.0.0 eslint-plugin-flowtype@2.21.0[m
[31m-```[m
[31m-[m
[31m-We recognize that this is suboptimal, but it is currently required due to the way we hide the ESLint dependency. The ESLint team is already [working on a solution to this](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/3458) so this may become unnecessary in a couple of months.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-## Debugging in the Editor[m
[31m-[m
[31m-**This feature is currently only supported by [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) editor.**[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Visual Studio Code supports live-editing and debugging out of the box with Create React App. This enables you as a developer to write and debug your React code without leaving the editor, and most importantly it enables you to have a continuous development workflow, where context switching is minimal, as you don’t have to switch between tools.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-You would need to have the latest version of [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and VS Code [Chrome Debugger Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome) installed.[m
[31m-[m

[31m-[m
[31m-Generally, we recommend that you don’t reuse the same CSS classes across different components. For example, instead of using a `.Button` CSS class in `<AcceptButton>` and `<RejectButton>` components, we recommend creating a `<Button>` component with its own `.Button` styles, that both `<AcceptButton>` and `<RejectButton>` can render (but [not inherit](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html)).[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Following this rule often makes CSS preprocessors less useful, as features like mixins and nesting are replaced by component composition. You can, however, integrate a CSS preprocessor if you find it valuable. In this walkthrough, we will be using Sass, but you can also use Less, or another alternative.[m

[31m-[m
[31m-Now you can rename `src/App.css` to `src/App.scss` and run `npm run watch-css`. The watcher will find every Sass file in `src` subdirectories, and create a corresponding CSS file next to it, in our case overwriting `src/App.css`. Since `src/App.js` still imports `src/App.css`, the styles become a part of your application. You can now edit `src/App.scss`, and `src/App.css` will be regenerated.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-To share variables between Sass files, you can use Sass imports. For example, `src/App.scss` and other component style files could include `@import "./shared.scss";` with variable definitions.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-At this point you might want to remove all CSS files from the source control, and add `src/**/*.css` to your `.gitignore` file. It is generally a good practice to keep the build products outside of the source control.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-As a final step, you may find it convenient to run `watch-css` automatically with `npm start`, and run `build-css` as a part of `npm run build`.

[31m-Flow is a static type checker that helps you write code with fewer bugs. Check out this [introduction to using static types in JavaScript](https://medium.com/@preethikasireddy/why-use-static-types-in-javascript-part-1-8382da1e0adb) if you are new to this concept.[m

[31m-[m
[31m-1. Run `npm install --save-dev flow-bin` (or `yarn add --dev flow-bin`).[m
[31m-2. Add `"flow": "flow"` to the `scripts` section of your `package.json`.[m
[31m-3. Run `npm run flow -- init` (or `yarn flow -- init`) to create a [`.flowconfig` file](https://flowtype.org/docs/advanced-configuration.html) in the root directory.[m
[31m-4. Add `// @flow` to any files you want to type check (for example, to `src/App.js`).[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Now you can run `npm run flow` (or `yarn flow`) to check the files for type errors.[m

[31m-## Adding Custom Environment Variables[m
[31m-[m
[31m->Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.2.3` and higher.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Your project can consume variables declared in your environment as if they were declared locally in your JS files. By[m
[31m-default you will have `NODE_ENV` defined for you, and any other environment variables starting with[m
[31m-`REACT_APP_`.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-**The environment variables are embedded during the build time**. Since Create React App produces a static HTML/CSS/JS bundle, it can’t possibly read them at runtime. To read them at runtime, you would need to load HTML into memory on the server and replace placeholders in runtime, just like [described here](#injecting-data-from-the-server-into-the-page). Alternatively you can rebuild the app on the server anytime you change them.[m
[31m-[m
[31m->Note: You must create custom environment variables beginning with `REACT_APP_`. Any other variables except `NODE_ENV` will be ignored to avoid accidentally [exposing a private key on the machine that could have the same name](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/865#issuecomment-252199527). Changing any environment variables will require you to restart the development server if it is running.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-These environment variables will be defined for you on `process.env`. For example, having an environment[m
[31m-variable named `REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE` will be exposed in your JS as `process.env.REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE`.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-There is also a special built-in environment variable called `NODE_ENV`. You can read it from `process.env.NODE_ENV`. When you run `npm start`, it is always equal to `'development'`, when you run `npm test` it is always equal to `'test'`, and when you run `npm run build` to make a production bundle, it is always equal to `'production'`. **You cannot override `NODE_ENV` manually.** This prevents developers from accidentally deploying a slow development build to production.[m

[31m-[m
[31m-People often serve the front-end React app from the same host and port as their backend implementation.<br>[m

[31m-[m
[31m-```[m

[31m-/api/todos    - server handles any /api/* requests using the backend implementation[m
[31m-```[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Such setup is **not** required. However, if you **do** have a setup like this, it is convenient to write requests like `fetch('/api/todos')` without worrying about redirecting them to another host or port during development.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-To tell the development server to proxy any unknown requests to your API server in development, add a `proxy` field to your `package.json`, for example:[m

[31m-```js[m
[31m-  "proxy": "http://localhost:4000",[m
[31m-```[m
[31m-[m
[31m-This way, when you `fetch('/api/todos')` in development, the development server will recognize that it’s not a static asset, and will proxy your request to `http://localhost:4000/api/todos` as a fallback. The development server will only attempt to send requests without a `text/html` accept header to the proxy.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Conveniently, this avoids [CORS issues](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21854516/understanding-ajax-cors-and-security-considerations) and error messages like this in development:[m
[31m-[m
[31m-```[m
[31m-Fetch API cannot load http://localhost:4000/api/todos. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost:3000' is therefore not allowed access. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.[m
[31m-```[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Keep in mind that `proxy` only has effect in development (with `npm start`), and it is up to you to ensure that URLs like `/api/todos` point to the right thing in production. You don’t have to use the `/api` prefix. Any unrecognized request without a `text/html` accept header will be redirected to the specified `proxy`.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-The `proxy` option supports HTTP, HTTPS and WebSocket connections.<br>[m

[31m-## Generating Dynamic `<meta>` Tags on the Server[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Since Create React App doesn’t support server rendering, you might be wondering how to make `<meta>` tags dynamic and reflect the current URL. To solve this, we recommend to add placeholders into the HTML, like this:[m
[31m-[m
[31m-```html[m
[31m-<!doctype html>[m
[31m-<html lang="en">[m
[31m-  <head>[m
[31m-    <meta property="og:title" content="__OG_TITLE__">[m
[31m-    <meta property="og:description" content="__OG_DESCRIPTION__">[m
[31m-```[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Then, on the server, regardless of the backend you use, you can read `index.html` into memory and replace `__OG_TITLE__`, `__OG_DESCRIPTION__`, and any other placeholders with values depending on the current URL. Just make sure to sanitize and escape the interpolated values so that they are safe to embed into HTML![m
[31m-[m
[31m-If you use a Node server, you can even share the route matching logic between the client and the server. However duplicating it also works fine in simple cases.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-## Pre-Rendering into Static HTML Files[m
[31m-[m
[31m-If you’re hosting your `build` with a static hosting provider you can use [react-snapshot](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-snapshot) to generate HTML pages for each route, or relative link, in your application. These pages will then seamlessly become active, or “hydrated”, when the JavaScript bundle has loaded.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-There are also opportunities to use this outside of static hosting, to take the pressure off the server when generating and caching routes.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-The primary benefit of pre-rendering is that you get the core content of each page _with_ the HTML payload—regardless of whether or not your JavaScript bundle successfully downloads. It also increases the likelihood that each route of your application will be picked up by search engines.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-You can read more about [zero-configuration pre-rendering (also called snapshotting) here](https://medium.com/superhighfives/an-almost-static-stack-6df0a2791319).[m
[31m-[m
[31m-## Injecting Data from the Server into the Page[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Similarly to the previous section, you can leave some placeholders in the HTML that inject global variables, for example:[m
[31m-[m
[31m-```js[m
[31m-<!doctype html>[m
[31m-<html lang="en">[m
[31m-  <head>[m
[31m-    <script>[m
[31m-      window.SERVER_DATA = __SERVER_DATA__;[m
[31m-    </script>[m
[31m-```[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Then, on the server, you can replace `__SERVER_DATA__` with a JSON of real data right before sending the response. The client code can then read `window.SERVER_DATA` to use it. **Make sure to [sanitize the JSON before sending it to the client](https://medium.com/node-security/the-most-common-xss-vulnerability-in-react-js-applications-2bdffbcc1fa0) as it makes your app vulnerable to XSS attacks.**[m

[31m-Create React App uses [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) as its test runner. To prepare for this integration, we did a [major revamp](https://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2016/09/01/jest-15.html) of Jest so if you heard bad things about it years ago, give it another try.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Jest is a Node-based runner. This means that the tests always run in a Node environment and not in a real browser. This lets us enable fast iteration speed and prevent flakiness.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-While Jest provides browser globals such as `window` thanks to [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom), they are only approximations of the real browser behavior. Jest is intended to be used for unit tests of your logic and your components rather than the DOM quirks.[m

[31m-### Filename Conventions[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Jest will look for test files with any of the following popular naming conventions:[m
[31m-[m
[31m-* Files with `.js` suffix in `__tests__` folders.[m

[31m-[m
[31m-We recommend to put the test files (or `__tests__` folders) next to the code they are testing so that relative imports appear shorter. For example, if `App.test.js` and `App.js` are in the same folder, the test just needs to `import App from './App'` instead of a long relative path. Colocation also helps find tests more quickly in larger projects.[m

[31m-The watcher includes an interactive command-line interface with the ability to run all tests, or focus on a search pattern.

[31m-By default, when you run `npm test`, Jest will only run the tests related to files changed since the last commit.

[31m-[m
[31m-Jest will always explicitly mention that it only ran tests related to the files changed since the last commit. You can also press `a` in the watch mode to force Jest to run all tests.[m

[31m-There is a broad spectrum of component testing techniques. They range from a “smoke test” verifying that a component renders without throwing, to shallow rendering and testing some of the output, to full rendering and testing component lifecycle and state changes.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Different projects choose different testing tradeoffs based on how often components change, and how much logic they contain. If you haven’t decided on a testing strategy yet, we recommend that you start with creating simple smoke tests for your components:[m

[31m-[m
[31m-This test mounts a component and makes sure that it didn’t throw during rendering. Tests like this provide a lot value with very little effort so they are great as a starting point, and this is the test you will find in `src/App.test.js`.[m

[31m-[m
[31m-Unlike the previous smoke test using `ReactDOM.render()`, this test only renders `<App>` and doesn’t go deeper. For example, even if `<App>` itself renders a `<Button>` that throws, this test will pass. Shallow rendering is great for isolated unit tests, but you may still want to create some full rendering tests to ensure the components integrate correctly. Enzyme supports [full rendering with `mount()`](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/mount.html), and you can also use it for testing state changes and component lifecycle.[m

[31m-#### Notes on client-side routing[m
[31m-[m
[31m-GitHub Pages doesn’t support routers that use the HTML5 `pushState` history API under the hood (for example, React Router using `browserHistory`). This is because when there is a fresh page load for a url like `http://user.github.io/todomvc/todos/42`, where `/todos/42` is a frontend route, the GitHub Pages server returns 404 because it knows nothing of `/todos/42`. If you want to add a router to a project hosted on GitHub Pages, here are a couple of solutions:[m
[31m-[m
[31m-* You could switch from using HTML5 history API to routing with hashes. If you use React Router, you can switch to `hashHistory` for this effect, but the URL will be longer and more verbose (for example, `http://user.github.io/todomvc/#/todos/42?_k=yknaj`). [Read more](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router/blob/master/docs/guides/Histories.md#histories) about different history implementations in React Router.[m
[31m-* Alternatively, you can use a trick to teach GitHub Pages to handle 404 by redirecting to your `index.html` page with a special redirect parameter. You would need to add a `404.html` file with the redirection code to the `build` folder before deploying your project, and you’ll need to add code handling the redirect parameter to `index.html`. You can find a detailed explanation of this technique [in this guide](https://github.com/rafrex/spa-github-pages).[m
